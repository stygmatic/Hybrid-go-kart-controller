J2: Analog input, throttle input read by ADC on the ATmega, determines throttle position for controlling either motor.

J3: Power input, 3.3V and GND to power the circuit, Pin 3 left unconnected.

J4: Digital input, on/off switch, controls power status of the system.

J5: Digital input, 3-way switch for mode selection (gas, electric, hybrid).

SW1: Digital input, push button for additional control (e.g., reset).

SPI Screen: SPI communication, displays mode, battery status, and speed.

J6: PWM output, controls the servo (gas motor throttle) and electric motor controller.

Throttle Output: PWM output, sends throttle signal to the electric motor controller.

SPI Display Output: Sends data to the display (mode, battery, speed).
